# Olympic Insights: Decoding Performance and Predicting Glory with Machine Learning

This project analyzes Olympic athlete data to explore performance trends and predict potential future medal winners using machine learning techniques. By processing historical Olympic data, the project provides insights into medal tally, overall athlete performance, country-wise analysis, and more.

## Project Overview

The main goal of the project is to decode historical Olympic performance data and predict future medal standings using machine learning. The app uses data analysis and visualization techniques to derive insights from the dataset. Additionally, it provides a machine learning framework for prediction, offering a user-friendly interface through **Streamlit**.

### Features:
- **Medal Tally**: Displays the total medal count for each country, ranked by gold medals.
- **Overall Analysis**: Provides an overall summary of the Olympics data.
- **Country-wise Analysis**: Displays medal performance for each country.
- **Athlete-wise Analysis**: Analyzes the performance of individual athletes over the years.

## Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezaanamin/Olympic-Insights-Decoding-Performance-and-Predicting-Glory-with-Machine-Learning.git
cd Olympic-Insights-Decoding-Performance-and-Predicting-Glory-with-Machine-Learning
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

For MacOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit app, and you can open it in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Dependencies

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

You can install all dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. **Medal Tally**: Displays the total number of medals for each country, grouped by gold, silver, and bronze.
2. **Overall Analysis**: A general overview of the data, including visualizations and summaries.
3. **Country-wise Analysis**: View medal performance across different countries.
4. **Athlete-wise Analysis**: Analyze the performance of individual athletes over time.

## Data

The project uses two datasets:

1. **athlete_events.csv**: Contains data about athletes, events, and medals.
2. **noc_regions.csv**: Contains mapping of National Olympic Committees (NOC) to their respective regions.

Both datasets are required for processing the Olympic data and generating visual insights.
